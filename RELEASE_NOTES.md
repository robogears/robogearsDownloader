# What's new in v0.1.22

## Queue row sizing fix
- Song titles in the queue are now always shown in full. The waveform is what shrinks when space is tight, not the title. Previously a long song name could get truncated to an ellipsis as the waveform held its 80 px minimum; now the title is sacred and the waveform yields whatever space it needs.

That's the whole release. Pure CSS tweak.

# Install

- **Windows**: download `robogears-downloader.exe`, double-click. Windows SmartScreen will warn the first time — click **More info → Run anyway**. Portable; runs from anywhere with no installer. Future updates apply themselves via the in-app updater.
- **macOS** (Apple Silicon): download `robogears-downloader-mac-arm64.dmg`, double-click it, then drag the app icon onto the Applications folder shortcut in the window that opens. **Don't forget** to allow the app in System Settings → Privacy & Security on first launch.

Config and TIDAL token are stored per-user (`%APPDATA%\Roaming\robogears Downloader\` on Windows, `~/Library/Application Support/robogears Downloader/` on macOS).

## Requirements

- A TIDAL subscription. The app uses TIDAL's official OAuth device-code flow — sign in once via Settings; tokens cache locally and auto-refresh.
- Spotify playlist support uses the public embed page and is capped at **100 tracks** per playlist (Spotify-side limit).
